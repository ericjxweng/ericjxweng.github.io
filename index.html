	<h12> Hello, My name is Eric Weng and I am currently a junior at Ruben S. Ayala High School. I live with my mother, father, and brother, William. I enjoy playing basketball, swimming, and coaching chess. I am involved with my church as I serve as a student leader and participate in church activities. I am currently in FBLA club since i enjoy business. I am enrolled as a student in the ACES program and in the Early College Program. In these classes, I learn skills that have helped me learn what different professionals do. Based on this, I would like to go on and pursuit a profession in pharmacy or engineering
